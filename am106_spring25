  <h1>Applied Math 106: Algebra for Models and Data. </h1>

<h3> Spring 2025, MW 3-4.15pm.</h3>

<p> Algebra is the study of operations (such as addition and multiplication) on objects 
(such as numbers, polynomials, and matrices).
This course is an introduction to abstract algebra and its applications.
Algebraic structure appears in problems in data analysis, modeling, and optimization. 
We will cover the abstract algebra theory required to extract insights in such contexts.</p>

<p> Recommended preparation for the course is familiarity with linear algebra (at the level of Math 21b) 
and proofs (at the level of Math 22a, Math 101, or CS 20). Programming experience is helpful but not required.</p>

<p> See <a href="spring25_syllabus.pdf">here</a> for the course syllabus.
