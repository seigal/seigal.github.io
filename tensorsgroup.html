  <h1>Foundational Tensor Theory Reading Group, Fall 2016</h1>

  <p> Mondays, 12pm-1pm. Evans Hall, Room 891 </p>

  <p> Organizers: Anna Seigal and Rocky Foster </p>

  <p> Based on the book "Tensor Spaces and Numerical Tensor Calculus" by Wolfgang Hackbusch. </p>

  <p> In this semester's version of the seminar, we are studying the third
part of the book, which primarily 
deals with representing and approximating tensors, and applications.  
Talks will be given on r-term representation, tensor subspace 
representation, a hybrid form between the two, as well as other topics
according to the interests of the speaker.  Please 
don't 
hesitate to join us:  all are welcome. </p>

  <p> November 14th: Nikhil Strivastava, <i>Area Laws for 1D Gapped 
Local Hamiltonians</i>. <span>Abstract: It has been 
observed for 
several 
decades by physicists that the low energy states of "low-dimensional" 
n-body quantum systems exhibit low entanglement --- i.e., they are in a 
certain sense well-approximated by tensors of low rank. Over the last 
few years this has been proven rigorously in the case of one dimensional 
lattices. We will survey some of the main techniques and results in this 
area (mainly following the papers of Arad, Landau, Vazirani, and 
Vidick). </span> </p>
